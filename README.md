2. Client enters email & password
3. Client moves slider to desired limit (e.g., 75)
4. Client uploads CSV with LinkedIn profile URLs
5. Client clicks "Start Processing"
6. Backend receives all data
7. Backend runs your `linkedin_bot.py` with their credentials
8. Bot starts sending connection requests
9. Client sees progress bar
10. Done!

---

## 🔐 SECURITY:

- Credentials used only during session
- Never stored anywhere
- Each client isolated
- CSV file validated
- Temp files auto-cleaned
